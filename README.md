# Richter's Predictor - Modeling Earthquake Damage

In 2015, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal, also called the Gorkha earthquake, killed about 9,000 people, injured many thousands more, and damaged or destroyed more than 600,000 buildings in Kathmandu and other nearby cities. Based on aspects of building location and construction, our goal is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the earthquake. Predicting the grade of damage could show which types of buildings are particularly vulnerable. This knowledge could help adapt the design of buildings to better withstand future earthquakes in Nepal and around the world. The data we are going to use for this project was collected through surveys commissioned by the National Planning Commission Secretariat of Nepal. It is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected.

The whole project is separated in three major steps each documented in its own notebook. Additionally, you find one notebook that visualizes the geospatial data we have. Here is a quick overview:
- 01_Data_Clean
- 02_Feature_Engineering
- 03_Model
- 04_Data_Geographical

The first three notebooks build on each other, while the fourth is standing on its own.
